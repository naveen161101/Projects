## Features

### üöÄ AI-Driven Account Intelligence

- **Automated Insights Table**: Get key intelligence (Recent Hires, Funding, Growth, Initiatives, Senior Management, Account Intelligence) packaged in a **clear, traceable markdown table with clickable source links**.

- **Web Scraping with Context**: Pulls and parses relevant company website sections (news, press, careers, about, IR). Automatically discovers and categorizes pages likely to contain intelligence.
- **Safe and Robust**: Gracefully handles and reports errors for unreachable or problematic web pages.

### üí° Relevance Evaluation

### üìä User-Friendly Intelligence Reports

- **Interactive Next-Gen Table**: All results are rendered as a markdown table or clickable pandas dataframe (Streamlit), so you can instantly verify every fact.
- **Expandable URL Explorer**: See all discovered and categorized URLs for manual review.

### üîí Secure & Configurable
